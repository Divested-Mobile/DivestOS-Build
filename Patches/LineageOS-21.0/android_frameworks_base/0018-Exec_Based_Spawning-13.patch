Subject: [PATCH] exec spawning: don't close the binder connection when the app
 crashes

When an unhandled exception occured, binder connections were closed with
IPCThreadState::stopProcess() before the invocation of java.lang.Thread#dispatchUncaughtException().
By default, that method tries to report the crash via ActivityManager#handleApplicationCrash(),
which always failed due to the closed binder connection.
This meant that the crash dialog was never shown and additional crash handling was skipped.

Zygote-based spawning never calls IPCThreadState::stopProcess().
