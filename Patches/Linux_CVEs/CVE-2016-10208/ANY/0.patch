Subject: [PATCH] ext4: validate s_first_meta_bg at mount time

Ralf Spenneberg reported that he hit a kernel crash when mounting a
modified ext4 image. And it turns out that kernel crashed when
calculating fs overhead (ext4_calculate_overhead()), this is because
the image has very large s_first_meta_bg (debug code shows it's
842150400), and ext4 overruns the memory in count_overhead() when
setting bitmap buffer, which is PAGE_SIZE.

ext4_calculate_overhead():
  buf = get_zeroed_page(GFP_NOFS);  <=== PAGE_SIZE buffer
  blks = count_overhead(sb, i, buf);

count_overhead():
  for (j = ext4_bg_num_gdb(sb, grp); j > 0; j--) { <=== j = 842150400
          ext4_set_bit(EXT4_B2C(sbi, s++), buf);   <=== buffer overrun
          count++;
  }

This can be reproduced easily for me by this script:

  #!/bin/bash
  rm -f fs.img
  mkdir -p /mnt/ext4
  fallocate -l 16M fs.img
  mke2fs -t ext4 -O bigalloc,meta_bg,^resize_inode -F fs.img
  debugfs -w -R "ssv first_meta_bg 842150400" fs.img
  mount -o loop fs.img /mnt/ext4

Fix it by validating s_first_meta_bg first at mount time, and
refusing to mount if its value exceeds the largest possible meta_bg
number.
