Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: console: fix use-after-free on disconnect

A clean-up patch removing two redundant NULL-checks from the console
disconnect handler inadvertently also removed a third check. This could
lead to the struct usb_serial being prematurely freed by the console
code when a driver accepts but does not register any ports for an
interface which also lacks endpoint descriptors.

Fixes: 0e517c93dc02 ("USB: serial: console: clean up sanity checks")
