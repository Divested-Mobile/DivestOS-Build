Subject: [PATCH] splice: introduce FMODE_SPLICE_READ and FMODE_SPLICE_WRITE

Introduce FMODE_SPLICE_READ and FMODE_SPLICE_WRITE. These modes check
whether it is legal to read or write a file using splice. Both get
automatically set on regular files and are not checked when a 'struct
fileoperations' includes the splice_{read,write} methods.
