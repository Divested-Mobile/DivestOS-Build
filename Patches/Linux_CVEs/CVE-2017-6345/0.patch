Subject: net/llc: avoid BUG_ON() in skb_orphan()

It seems nobody used LLC since linux-3.12.

Fortunately fuzzers like syzkaller still know how to run this code,
otherwise it would be no fun.

Setting skb->sk without skb->destructor leads to all kinds of
bugs, we now prefer to be very strict about it.

Ideally here we would use skb_set_owner() but this helper does not exist yet,
only CAN seems to have a private helper for that.

Fixes: 376c7311bdb6 ("net: add a temporary sanity check in skb_orphan()")
