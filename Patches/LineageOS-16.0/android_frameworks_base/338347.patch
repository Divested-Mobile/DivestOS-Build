Subject: [PATCH] Parcel: recycle recycles

Before, it was like getting a used pan with food stuck on it. We run
a clean ship here. You want a Parcel? You get a fresh Parcel. When
we recycle a Parcel, we do a real clean-up job. Air freshener. All
bits brushed over. These Parcel objects are clean as heck now!

(specifically cleans mClassCookies)
