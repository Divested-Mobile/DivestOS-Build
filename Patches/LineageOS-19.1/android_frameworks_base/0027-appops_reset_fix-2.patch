Subject: [PATCH] appops: skip ops for invalid null package during state
 serialization

There's a bug that leads to construction of ops for invalid null package name.
Package name should always be non-null, it's defined and treated as such in AppOpsService.
It being null leads to crashes in system_server when appops state is serialized.

Previous commit reverted a buggy workaround for this bug, add a new workaround to prevent these
crashes.
